## What this is

On-demand skills linked at install time so agents claim territory, run merge-brief, and self-check config. Snippets are one-line pointers into those skills (Claude `CLAUDE.md`, Grok-native `AGENTS.md`, statusline segment for "Asking Sage"). Keeps a disabled SAGE nearly free in prompt weight.

## Anchors

- `skills/sage-fleet/SKILL.md` — coordination protocol
- `skills/sage-doctor/SKILL.md` — `/sage-doctor` validity check
- `templates/*.snippet.md` — paste targets for harness docs and statusline

## Invariants

Prefer empty until verified.
